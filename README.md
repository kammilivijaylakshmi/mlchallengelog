100 Days of ML Code Challenge

Day 1 : August 21, 2018

Today's Progress : Started with Math and completed some lectures from MIT Opencourseware by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Its a linear algebra course that i am going through now. Topics include : Geometry of linear algebra, Matrices, Eliminations, Multiplication and Inverse.

Thoughts : Its always fun learning or practising Math. I almost went back to my school days. As it is my first day, I just completed a little. But planning to cover more topics from tomorrow. I love matrices and its one of my favourite topics.
