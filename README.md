100 Days of ML Code Challenge

Day 1 : August 20, 2018

Today's Progress : Started with Math and completed some lectures from MIT Opencourseware by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Its a linear algebra course that i am going through now. Topics includes : Geometry of linear algebra, Matrices, Eliminations, Multiplication and Inverse.

Thoughts : Its always fun to learn or practice Math. I almost went back to my school days. As it is my first day, I just completed a little. But planning to cover more topics from tomorrow. I love matrices and its one of my favourite topics.

Day 2 : August 21, 2018

Today's Progress : Continued with the math lectures on Linear Algebra from MIT Opencourseware by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Topics includes : Factorization, Transpose, Permutations. Worked with python on matrices. Started coding math in python.

Thoughts : The lectures are very interesting and I find them easy.

Day 3 : August 28, 2018

Today's Progress : Watched lecture on linear regression using gradient descent by @Siraj Raval. Its a good video to go through. The topic gradient descent was explained very well in the video. The math was explained with the help of a program parallely. 

Thoughts : The lecture was good and the coding part was really fun. I enjoyed and learned together from the video.
