100 Days of ML Code Challenge

Day 1 : August 20, 2018

Today's Progress : Started with Math and completed some lectures from MIT Opencourseware by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Its a linear algebra course that i am going through now. Topics includes : Geometry of linear algebra, Matrices, Eliminations, Multiplication and Inverse.

Thoughts : Its always fun to learn or practice Math. I almost went back to my school days. As it is my first day, I just completed a little. But planning to cover more topics from tomorrow. I love matrices and its one of my favourite topics.

Day 2 : August 21, 2018

Today's Progress : Continued with the math lectures on Linear Algebra from MIT Opencourseware by Prof. Gilbert Strang. Topics includes : Factorization, Transpose, Permutations. Worked with python on matrices. Started coding math in python.

Thoughts : The lectures are very interesting and I find them easy.

Day 3 : August 28, 2018

Today's Progress : Watched lecture on linear regression using gradient descent by Siraj Raval. Its a good video to go through. The topic gradient descent with math was explained very well in the video.  

Thoughts : The lecture was good and the coding part was really fun. I enjoyed and learned together from the video.

Day 4 : August 29, 2018

Today's Progress : I explored Microsoft azure machine learning studio today. It’s a drag and drop tool used to build, test and deploy predictive Analytics of our data. There’s no programming needed. I liked it and recommend to the beginners of machine learning.

Thoughts : It is a easy tool to use. I would like to explore more about the microsoft azure for machine learning. I will do some experiments and post the link here.

Day 5 : August 30, 2018

Today's Progress : I have taken the dataset from azure and predicted the car prices using the characteristics of the car. I used microsoft azure tool to do this and its really cool.

Thoughts : Its a regression problem and tried different regression models and got the better accuracy with the boost regression model.

Day 6 : August 5, 2018

Today's Progress : Started a course in coursera on Introduction to Data Science in python by University of Michigan. 

Thoughts : Its more about python and data science a good course for intermediate programmers.
